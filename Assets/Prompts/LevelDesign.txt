We need to generate a level design for a board game. Level design output will be in the form of grid.
Each element inside a grid represents a tile and each tile may or may not contain board elements like character, balloon, obstacles etc.
If a tile contains a board element, it should be represented by a number greater than 1.
If a tile does not contain a board element, it should be represented by either 0 or 1.
1 means walkable tile.
0 means non walkable tile.
There are following board elements:
11 means red balloon.
215 means red character.
12 means red obstacle.

Generated grid should contain either 0 or 1 or the board elements mentioned above.
There can be only one character in the grid.
All the board elements should be walkable except for obstacles.
For a valid grid, there must be a walkable path from character to balloon.
Path is defined as a series of walkable tiles either horizontally or vertically.

For grid below:
4 0 215
2 7 1
6 3 11
List of all tiles with their representation along with the value at that tile:
(1,1): 4. Tile is walkable
(1,2): 0. Tile is not walkable
(1,3): 215. Tile is walkable
(2,1): 2. Tile is walkable
(2,2): 7. Tile is walkable
(2,3): 1. Tile is walkable
(3,1): 6. Tile is walkable
(3,2): 3. Tile is walkable
(3,3): 11. Tile is walkable

For example:
Example 1:
1   1 1
215 0 1
0   0 11
there is a path from character to balloon as follows: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
(2,1) is the representation of tile where character is present. Here 2 means row number and 1 means column number.
Value at tile (1,3) is 0 and hence not walkable.

Example 2:
0 215 0
0 1   11
0 0   0
there is a path from character to balloon as follows: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)

Example 3:
0 0 215
0 0 1
0 0 11
there is a path from character to balloon as follows: (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

Example 4:
0 0 0
0 0 11
0 0 215
there is a path from character to balloon as follows: (3,3) -> (2,3)

Prompt: Generate a grid of 3 rows and 4 columns. Also find a path from character to balloon in the generated grid.
Completion: 
0 215 0  0
0 1   0  0
0 1   1 11
Path : (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4)

Prompt: Generate a grid of 3 rows and 3 columns. Also find a path from character to balloon in the generated grid.
